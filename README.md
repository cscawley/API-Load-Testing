# Getting Started

Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

Replace run.json with a copy of your postman collection.

Make sure you have at least 2GB of memory to dedicate to load testing.

```
npm start
```

If you increase the parallels, you'll need to increase the ammount of memory allocated to Node.

```shell
npm run 10gig
```
